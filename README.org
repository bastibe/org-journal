** Synopsis

=org-journal= maintains a set of files, depending on the value of
=org-journal-file-type=, a file represents a day, week, month or year. When
=org-journal-file-type= is set to ='daily=, each file represent a day. In case
=org-journal-file-type= is set to ='weekly=, a file represents a week,
etc. Convenient bindings allow the creation of journal records in the current
daily, weekly, monthly or yearly file and search within all records or
specified time intervals. All records can be browsed and searched from the
Emacs Calendar for convenience. All entries in a specified TODO state will be
carried over to the next day, see =org-journal-carryover-items=. Optionally,
the journal entry can be encrypted, so can the file, see
=org-journal-enable-encryption= and =org-journal-encrypt-journal=,
respectively.

Every journal entry must have a *CREATED* property when using yearly, monthly
and weekly journal files. This property is added by =org-journal-new-entry=
automatically.

An example of a daily file (it will actually look a lot nicer, depending on
your org-mode
settings):

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE org
  * Tuesday, 06/04/13
  ** 10:28 Company meeting
  Endless discussions about projects. Not much progress

  ** 11:33 Work on org-journal
  For the longest time, I wanted to have a cool diary app on my
  computer. However, I simply lacked the right tool for that job. After
  many hours of searching, I finally found PersonalDiary on EmacsWiki.
  PersonalDiary is a very simple diary system based on the emacs
  calendar. It works pretty well, but I don't really like that it only
  uses unstructured text.

  Thus, I spent the last two hours making that diary use org-mode
  and represent every entry as an org-mode headline. Very cool!

  ** 15:33 Work on org-journal
  Now my journal automatically creates the right headlines (adds the
  current time stamp if on the current day, does not add a time stamp
  for any other day). Additionally, it automatically collapses the
  headlines in the org-file to the right level (shows everything if in
  view mode, shows only headlines in new-entry-mode). Emacs and elisp
  are really cool!

  ** 16:40 Work on org-journal
  I uploaded my journal mode to marmalade and Github! Awesome!

** Installation

=org-journal= is available through [[http://marmalade-repo.org/][marmalade]], [[http://melpa.milkbox.net/][melpa]] and [[http://melpa-stable.milkbox.net/][melpa-stable]]. So installation
should be trivial:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    M-x package-install org-journal
#+END_EXAMPLE

Then add =(require 'org-journal)= to your =.emacs=.

** Quickstart

Doing =M-x org-journal-new-entry= (or =C-c C-j=) will immediately create a journal
directory in the default path (customized using the =org-journal-dir= variable), open or
create a file in =org-journal-mode=, and insert a template for a new journal entry.

The same command with a prefix argument (=C-u C-c C-j=) will do everything mentioned while
skipping entry creation, which is useful for looking at the current journal file.

** Basic Usage

Bindings available in =org-journal-mode=:

- =C-c C-f= - go to the next journal file.

- =C-c C-b= - go to the previous journal file.

- =C-c C-j= - insert a new entry into the current journal file (creates the file if not
  present).

- =C-c C-s= - search the journal for a string.

All journal entries are registered in the Emacs Calendar. To see available journal
entries do =M-x calendar=. Bindings available in the =calendar-mode=:

- =j= - view an entry in a new buffer.

- =C-j= - view an entry but do not switch to it.

- =i j= - add a new entry into the day's file (creates the file if not present).

- =f w= - search in all entries of the current week.

- =f m= - search in all entries of the current month.

- =f y= - search in all entries of the current year.

- =f f= - search in all entries of all time.

- =f F= - search in all entries in the future.

- =[= - go to previous day with journal entries.

- =]= - go to next day with journal entries.

** Setup and customization

The following variables can be customized through =M-x customize=, or configured programmatically in your =.init.el=.
When configuring manually, the use of =customize-set-variable= is advised over =setq=, since =org-journal= has customization hooks that update auxiliary variables which might not be picked up if set via =setq=.

See below for an example.

*** Journal Directory and Files

Customization options related to journal directory and files:

- =org-journal-dir= - the journal path. Tweaking this variable will also update
  =auto-mode-alist= to ensure journal files are opened in =org-journal-mode=.

- =org-journal-file-format= - format string for journal file names (may contain directories relative to =org-journal-dir=).

- =org-journal-find-file= - a function to use when opening a journal file. By default it
  opens a window using =find-file-other-window=. Set this to =find-file= if you don't want
  org-journal to split your window.

- =org-extend-today-until= - a number that indicates the hour of
  /your/ end of the day. If you create a new entry with
  =org-journal-new-entry= earlier than this time, the journal entry
  will go into the previous day's journal.

- =org-journal-file-type= - the journal file type either 'daily (default),
  'weekly, 'monthly or 'yearly.  Also see the customizable variables
  =org-journal-start-on-weekday= for changing the start of the week for weekly
  journals (defaults to Monday). Keep in mind changing
  =org-journal-start-on-weekday= won't work for existing weekly journal files.

*** Journal File Content

Customization options related to the journal file contents:

- =org-journal-date-format= - date format =org-journal= uses when showing a
  date within a journal and search results page. It can also be a function,
  which return value will than be inserted.

- =org-journal-date-prefix= - this string will prefix the date at the top of a
  journal file.

- =org-journal-time-format= - a timestamp format that will prefix every entry
  within a daily journal file.

- =org-journal-time-prefix= - a string that will prefix every entry within a
  daily journal file.

- =org-journal-file-header= - a string that will be inserted at the top of
  every new journal file. If a string, it will be passed to
  `format-time-string` along the time value of the new journal entry.
  It can also be a function expecting a time value.

  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE emacs-lisp
  (defun org-journal-file-header-func (time)
    "Custom function to create journal header."
    (concat
      (pcase org-journal-file-type
        (`daily "#+TITLE: Daily Journal\n#+STARTUP: showeverything")
        (`weekly "#+TITLE: Weekly Journal\n#+STARTUP: folded")
        (`monthly "#+TITLE: Monthly Journal\n#+STARTUP: folded")
        (`yearly "#+TITLE: Yearly Journal\n#+STARTUP: folded"))))

  (setq org-journal-file-header 'org-journal-file-header-func)
  #+END_EXAMPLE

*** An example setup

A very basic example of customization.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE emacs-lisp
(customize-set-variable 'org-journal-dir "~/org/journal/")
(customize-set-variable 'org-journal-date-format "%A, %d %B %Y")
(require 'org-journal)
#+END_EXAMPLE

For users of =use-package=, this setup could look like the following:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE emacs-lisp
(use-package org-journal
  :ensure t
  :defer t
  :custom
  (org-journal-dir "~/org/journal/")
  (org-journal-date-format "%A, %d %B %Y"))
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Advanced Usage
*** Searching the Journal

=org-journal= has two searching options: the usual =org-mode= agenda search and the
built-in plain text search. The former can become slow with bigger journals, so the
built-in search is a recommended option.

To use the agenda search, you can add all journal entries to your org-agenda by adding
=org-journal-dir= to =org-agenda-files= and setting =org-agenda-file-regexp= to include
files matching your =org-journal-file-pattern=.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE emacs-lisp
  ;; When =org-journal-file-pattern= has the default value, this would be the regex.
  (setq org-agenda-file-regexp "\\`\\\([^.].*\\.org\\\|[0-9]\\\{8\\\}\\\(\\.gpg\\\)?\\\)\\'")
  (add-to-list 'org-agenda-files org-journal-dir)
#+END_EXAMPLE

However, this can become /very/ slow if you have many journal entries. As a compromize,
you can set =org-journal-enable-agenda-integration= to =t=, which automatically adds the
current and all future journal entries to the agenda. This is enough to get an overview
over current and future tasks.

The built-in search is available through the following function: =org-journal-search=
(=C-c C-s= in =org-journal-mode=). By default, it will ask for the time interval to search
within (accepting the =org-read-date= format such as "-1y" or "-1m") and the string to
search for. Given a prefix argument (=C-u org-journal-search=), it will go through the
whole journal.

The order of the search results (ascending or descending by date) can be customized using
the =org-journal-search-results-order-by= variable.

Search is also available through the Emacs Calendar as described in "Basic Usage".

*** Carry Over

By default, =org-journal= will try to /carry over/ previous day TODO-marked
items whenever a new journal file is created. The older journal entry will be
/moved/ (i.e., deleted and reinserted) to the current day's file.

This feature is controlled through the =org-journal-carryover-items=
variable. To disable this feature set =org-journal-carryover-items= to an
empty string =""=. Any [[http://orgmode.org/manual/Matching-tags-and-properties.html][agenda tags view match string]], tags, properties, and
todo states are allowed. By default this is ~TODO=”TODO”~. Which will
match TODO items.

*** Encryption

The journal entry can be encrypted using =org-crypt=, to enable it set
~org-journal-enable-encryption~ to =t=.

You can also encrypt the journal files itself by setting the variable
~org-journal-encrypt-journal~ to =t=. =org-journal= will always search for
journal files with the =.gpg= extension, and highlights them in the calendar,
etc., regardless of the value of ~org-journal-encrypt-journal~.
See the info page =(info "(epa)Encrypting/decrypting gpg files")= for more
information about gpg encryption in Emacs.

*** Agenda and Scheduling

An easy way of keeping track of appointments or future TODOs is to simply create a journal
entry in the future. Such entries will automatically get a timestamp and show up in the
current day's journal entry once you reach that day.

- if =org-journal-enable-agenda-integration= is =t=, org-journal will automatically add
  the current and all future journal entries to =org-agenda-files=.

There are a few helper functions to deal with such scheduled entries:

- =org-journal-new-scheduled-entry= - prompts for a date, and creates a new journal entry
  on that date with its timestamp set to the date. By default, this is a TODO entry. Set
  the prefix to avoid the TODO.

- =org-journal-schedule-view= - creates a read-only overview of scheduled entries.

**** iCalendar export

You can export your scheduled entries to an iCalendar file, and subscribe to that file in
your calendar application. You need to enable the agenda integration for this to work. I
also recommend you set the following values before exporting:

#+begin_src elisp
(setq org-journal-enable-agenda-integration t
      org-icalendar-store-UID t
      org-icalendar-include-todo "all"
      org-icalendar-combined-agenda-file "~/path/to/org-journal.ics")
#+end_src

With this done, you can export your agenda, including your scheduled entries, with =(org-icalendar-combine-agenda-files)=.

*** Journal Capture Template

You can configure a capture template in order to integrate =org-journal= with =org-capture=,
as in the following example:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE emacs-lisp
  (defun org-journal-find-location ()
    ;; Open today's journal, but specify a non-nil prefix argument in order to
    ;; inhibit inserting the heading; org-capture will insert the heading.
    (org-journal-new-entry t)
    ;; Position point on the journal's top-level heading so that org-capture
    ;; will add the new entry as a child entry.
    (goto-char (point-min)))

  (setq org-capture-templates '(("j" "Journal entry" entry (function org-journal-find-location)
                                 "* %(format-time-string org-journal-time-format)%^{Title}\n%i%?")))
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** Caching of journal dates
Since version 2.0.0 a cache has been added to speed up calendar
operations. This should drastically improve the performance when using
encrypted journal files, see =org-journal-encrypt-journal=.

The caching functionality can be enabled by settings
=org-journal-enable-cache= to =t=. The cache can be reset by calling
=org-journal-invalidate-cache=.

** FAQ

*** Can I use weekly/monthly/yearly journal entries instead of daily ones?

Yes, see =org-journal-file-type=.

*** Can I have multiple journals?

At the moment, this is not possible. But it should be possible to switch the
value of =org-journal-directory= using a custom function or directory local
variables.

*** Can I use org-journal with Spacemacs?

Yes you can!

- To use =org-journal= with Spacemacs from the =master= branch, you must do this:

  1. =git clone https://github.com/borgnix/spacemacs-journal.git ~/.emacs.d/private/journal=
  2. add it to your =~/.spacemacs=. You will need to add =journal= to the
     existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in this file.

  The manual of the journal layer can be found at https://github.com/borgnix/spacemacs-journal

- If you use Spacemacs from the =develop= branch you can enable =org-journal= by
  setting =org-enable-org-journal-support= to =t=, see [[https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/tree/develop/layers/+emacs/org#org-journal-support][Spacemacs org-journal support]].

*** Some key-bindings in org-journal conflict with org-mode key bindings

Minor modes are supposed to only use key bindings of the form =C-c C-?=, where =?= can be any letter, and to not overwrite major mode bindings. With org-mode already using most interesting keys, collisions are inevitable. This means that some org-journal key bindings will not work as expected in an org-mode buffer, and also that some org-mode key bindings will not work as expected in an org-journal buffer.

When working in an org-mode buffer the following org-journal key bindings are overwritten:
- =C-c C-s= (=org-journal-search=) with =org-schedule=
- =C-c C-f= (=org-journal-open-next-entry=) with =org-forward-heading-same-level=
- =C-c C-b= (=org-journal-open-previous-entry=) with =org-backward-heading-same-level=
- =C-c C-j= (=org-journal-new-entry=) with =org-goto=

When working in an org-journal buffer the following org-mode key bindings are overwritten:
- =C-c C-s= (=org-schedule=) with =org-journal-search=
- =C-c C-f= (=org-forward-heading-same-level=) with =org-journal-open-next-entry=
- =C-c C-b= (=org-backward-heading-same-level=) with =org-journal-open-previous-entry=
- =C-c C-j= (=org-goto=) with =org-journal-new-entry=

To workaround this, you can use user bindings of the form =C-c ?=, where =?= can be any letter, to call the org-journal functions. This allows you to have a set of keybindings that work the same in org-mode and org-journal buffers. However, this is Emacs, and if you don't like a key binding, change it!

*** Opening journal entries from the calendar are not editable

Old entries are opened in =view-mode=, which has convenient key bindings for browsing files. Most notably, you can quickly close =view-mode= buffers with =q=, scroll them with the =SPC= and =DEL=, or quit =view-mode= with =e=.

*** Can I insert some text on a newly created journal file?

Yes, you can write a custom function and assign it =org-journal-date-format=.
