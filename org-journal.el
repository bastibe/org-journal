;; Functions to maintain a simple personal diary / journal in Emacs.
;; Feel free to use, modify and improve the code! - mtvoid, bastibe

;; This file is also available from marmalade as
;; http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/journal. After installing, add
;; the line (require 'org-journal) to your .emacs or init.el to activate
;; it. You also need to specify the directory where your journal files
;; will be saved. You can do this by setting the variable journal-dir
;; (remember to add a trailing slash). journal-dir is also a
;; customizable variable. The default value for journal-dir is
;; ~/Documents/journal/.
;;
;; Inside the journal directory, a separate file is created for each
;; day with a journal entry, with a file name in the format YYYYMMDD
;; (this is customizable). Each journal entry is an org-mode file that
;; begins with a date entry on the top, followed by entries for a
;; different times. Any subsequent entries on the same day are written
;; in the same file, with their own timestamp. You can customize the
;; date and time formats (or remove them entirely). To start writing a
;; journal entry, "M-x org-journal-new-entry". You can also open the
;; current day's entry without adding a new entry with "C-u M-x
;; org-journal-new-entry".
;;
;; You can browse through existing journal entries on disk via the
;; calendar. All dates for which an entry is present are highlighted.
;; Pressing "j" will open it up for viewing. Pressing "C-j" will open
;; it for viewing, but not switch to it. Pressing "[" or "]" will
;; select the date with the previous or next journal entry,
;; respectively. Pressing "i j" will create a new entry for the chosen
;; date.
;;
;; TODO items from the previous day will carry over to the current
;; day. This is customizable through org-journal-carryover-items.
;;
;; Quick summary:
;; To create a new journal entry for the current time and day: M-x org-journal-new-entry
;; To open today's journal without creating a new entry: C-u M-x org-journal-new-entry
;; In calendar view: j m to mark entries in calendar
;;                   j r to view an entry in a new buffer
;;                   j d to view an entry but not switch to it
;;                   j n to add a new entry
;;                   j s w to search all entries of the current week
;;                   j s m to search all entries of the current month
;;                   j s y to search all entries of the current year
;;                   j s f to search all entries of all time
;;                   j s F to search all entries in the future
;;                   [ to go to previous entry
;;                   ] to go to next entry
;; When viewing a journal entry: C-c C-b to view previous entry
;;                               C-c C-f to view next entry
